# Emacs configuration

This configuration is for Doom Emacs (to be put in `~/.config/doom` or
`~/.doom.d`). If you want to check my previous configuration, have a look at the
`before-doom` tag.

## Why

Emacs' defaults are still largely outdated. While I have been using Emacs for
more than 20 years and despite a recent rework with `use-package` (see
`before-use-package`), my setup was largely inferior to what Doom Emacs provide
by default, notably speed, visuals, and functionalities. Modern features are
always a bit difficult to integrate properly, like LSP, Tree-sitter or just
childframe. Doom Emacs helps a lot for this. Moreover, many of my own
customizations are already present in Doom Emacs.
